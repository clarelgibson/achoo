# Achoo!

Can my Apple Health data help me predict how many times I'll sneeze in a day?

## Description

I am a chronic sneezer. Some days I can sneeze all day and all night long. The sneeze seems to be my body's default reaction to any kind of respiratory irritant. I have been diagnosed as having allergies to dust, grass pollen and cat hair, so my allergic sneezing happens all year round. On top of that, whenever I get any kind of respiratory virus (cold, flu, Covid), sneezing is my number one symptom.

Since 1 May 2025 I have been keeping count of the number of times I sneeze per day. I started doing this primarily to track which days were my particularly bad "attack" days, but because I also wear an Apple Watch, I wondered if I might be able to discover any patterns within my health data that might help to predict my sneeze count. It's also an opportunity for me to practise some data science.
